# Control Tools

The Control Tools example is deprecated and no longer maintained.  WebVIs should instead use the [Control Extensions for WebVI](https://bit.ly/webvi-control-extensions) example instead which uses a simplified control reference based API.

For archival purposes: [last commit](https://github.com/rajsite/webvi-experiments/tree/9064bba6d29523b30de4f18ff0b5e48280d3cf5a/ControlTools).
